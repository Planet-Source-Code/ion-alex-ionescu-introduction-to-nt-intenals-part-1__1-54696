## Introduction to NT Intenals, Part 1


</div>

### Description

Hi Everyone!

It's been a long time I haven't contributed with an article to the PSC community, but after a couple of months of writing, I'm back with Part 1 of my "NT Internals" article.

The series will deal with NT Objects, which is how the NT Kernel basically manages all its "components". A File is an Object, a Process is an Object, an Event is an Object, etc.

Part 1 deals with Processes, Threads and Jobs (and Fibers, although they are not Objects, but included because Part 1 deals with executable code).

At roughly 125 pages, it's a hefty read, but it's mostly garnered as a reference tool, not a teaching tool. However, it's more of a hybrid, so reading the beginnings of each chapter will give you an impression of how everything works. That's only about 10 pages of reading :)

I hope you enjoy it, and please vote... I'm still 18 and this feels like my life's work ;)

PS. Some parts have some typing/colouring mistakes...I'm working on fixing that.
